# Bertram_freezing_analysis.py
Detection of droplet freezing temperatures for ice nucleation research. Made for the Bertram Lab at UBC.

## Purpose
This code was designed to be an improvement to a similar analysis code written in MatLab by previous members of the Bertram Lab. However, due to difficulties in accessibility and usability with MatLab, this alternative Python code was created. This Python analysis code is more user-friendly, faster, and more accurate than its MatLab predecessor.

## How To
Refer to the SOP in the respository for detailed instructions to operate the code.
