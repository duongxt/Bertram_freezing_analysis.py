# Bertram_freezing_analysis.py
Detection of droplet freezing temperatures for ice nucleation research. Made for the Bertram Lab at UBC.

## Purpose
This code was designed to be an improvement to a similar analysis code written in MatLab by previous members of the Bertram Lab, allowing for allowing better accessibility and usability. This Python analysis code is user-friendly, faster, and provides accurate freezing temperatures for droplet freezing techniques.

## How To
Refer to the SOP in the respository for detailed instructions to operate the code.
